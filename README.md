# OEE-SMIP-App

A GraphQL-based web App for the CESMII SM Innovation Platform.

This app uses a ThinkIQ Library, including standard Type definitions (available in the CESMII Cloud Library) that computes OEE, and its component functions, for any equipment (given a few key datapoints).

The app is written in pure Javascript (Vue) using the GraphQL API provided by the SMIP. For more details, see the [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).
